**Hola @all**, before you even ask, some pertinent questions very succinctly answered.


####Who am I ?
Just another developer who is also an aspiring entrepreneur and researcher. 

####What do I do?
A lot of things, but currently I'm working as a Research Associate under **[Dr.Pushpendra Singh](https://www.iiitd.edu.in/~pushpendra/)** in IIIT - Delhi.

####What I did?
I was the second guy to complete Dual Degree in Computer Science from IIIT - Delhi, not sure if it counts as an achievement.
