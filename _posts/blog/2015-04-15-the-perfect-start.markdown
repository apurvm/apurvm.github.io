After three weeks of pondering over one question and the outcome delaying this post by more than a couple of months, given the time it has taken me to materialize a blog because of one lingering question - 'How to make a perfect start ?'. Right now I can think of only one person who takes so much time to come up with vacuous answers to obvious questions, Mr. Rahul Gandhi. (Answer to my problem is not women empowerment #JustSaying)

I had become obsessed with the question idea of a perfect start, to come up with a valid topic for post, do extensive research on it, perfect the English and control all the other variables which resulted in a 'No Start'. So sometime back I decided the best start would be to figure out and write about the best start (recursion :P) and so I tried. I'm not going to build a story for a mindless anti-climax, I could not figure it out. So I did what any intelligent person would do, find a question that you can answer. 

So here is the new question, why do we wait for perfect start ? The context is given that you have decided to go ahead with some change in your life, it can be starting to work out, changing your job, starting your pet project or in fact taking up anything new singing, dancing, coding, cleaning your room etc. blogging in my case. The assumption is that you have weighed in all the pros and cons and are firm with the decision the problem is the execution ( Big assumption I agree but then most of them are !!! )

The results are based on my understanding of some studies and the examples are mostly derived from real ones and biased.
	1. Change: I believe many of us happily fall prey to our habits(interestingly sometimes developed subconsciously by others rather than consciously by us) and to be doing what we are doing even if things aren't going smoothly. We get used to the routine and have shaped ourselves to fit in the mould created by someone else, quite possibly even if we know it's not good fit. There has been enough research on why habits are hard to break ad what goes on inside the brain[1].
		A possible reasons 
			Supernatural Stimuli/ Continuous Stimuli
			Artificial Road blocks in minds
			Urgent vs Important
			Fear of change/consequences
				We avoid unchartered territory since maybe we are biologically hardwired not to..
	2. How do we quickly adapt to something shitty even when we know its shitty ?
		The 'chalta h' attitude that I very commonly see in most people around me and I guess we have started applying it to our lives as well. eg.

	Why to change ? No reasons from my end. Change only if you want to.	But would like to share a line from 
	(http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/feb/01/top-five-regrets-of-the-dying)'I wish that I had let myself be happier: This is a surprisingly common one. Many did not realise until the end that happiness is a choice. They had stayed stuck in old patterns and habits. The so-called 'comfort' of familiarity overflowed into their emotions, as well as their physical lives'.
		
		
	How to Beat or atleast cheat :P
	1. Awareness -- We need extra push convince the brain to logically overcome the fear or/and anxiety and look into the positives( long term gratification.( Marshmellow experiment) Awareness about the stuff that's happening.  Getting rid of the supernatural stimuli or at least avoid the hooks.
		things I use 
			do not disturb chrome notification
			facebook deactivated
			whatsapp - all groups on mute 
			quora - all mails go to forum tab on mailbox, which I do not check
			phone - profile changed to silent.
	2. 1 applies. you should become aware that the roadblocks are artificial. Discussing with someone to get fresh perspective(maybe point out the artificial roadblocks). Get positive peer pressure ( How does it actually work ? ) ( Ask a friend to accompany you to the gym, or ask a friend to point out to you everytime he sees you indulge in X)
	3. Eliminate/Avoid the anxiety or fear or finds ways to ameliorate the fear. 
		Worst Case Analysis helps
	
	
	If you made it this far, you must have figured it out, this post is for me to overcome effect 3. It is as imperfect as me but I can happily sleep tonight since I know that they'll improve iteratively, like me. 
	
	Let me try again - 'How to make a perfect start ?' You just did.
	
	Thanks for reading and stay curious ;)
